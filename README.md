# kitti_channel_sampling

Channel sampling code for **kitti tracking benchmark dataset** which is composed of point clouds.

## Usage


<!-- [[Paper]](paper_address) -->

<!-- ## Overview
`RSMix` generates the virtual sample from each part of the two point cloud samples by mixing them without shape distortion. It effectively generalize the deep neural network model and achieve remarkable performance for shape classification. -->
